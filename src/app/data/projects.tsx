          1. On-Chain Data: - Explored and extracted lending and borrowing
          histories from Moola Market and Aave on-chain data. - Implemented
          smart contracts for secure data extraction, ensuring transparency in
          decentralized finance activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Features: - Extracted features by analyzing Moola Market's and
          Aave's data
        </p>
        <p>
          3. ML Model: - Implemented machine learning algorithms for predicting
          credit score
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Score: - Designed a scoring framework combining ML insights with
          transparent on-chain data from Moola Market and Aave. - Developed a
          user-friendly interface for clear presentation of Web3 credit scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Development Challenges: - Addressed interoperability challenges
          between Web2 and Web3 technologies. - Ensured security and privacy in
          handling sensitive on-chain data from Moola Market and Aave.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Adaptability: - Stayed updated on the evolving Web3 landscape,
          adapting the credit scoring system to changes in decentralized
          technologies and lending dynamics.
