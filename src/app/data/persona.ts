const aboutme = `I have nearly three years of experience in blockchain technology and decentralized systems. My undergraduate thesis addressed the blockchain trilemma, leading to the design of the Mini-Shard Chain and the development of the Proof-of-Duty consensus algorithm. I have contributed to over 10 R&D projects, implementing standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, and performing in-depth analyses of Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains.
<br>
My work has garnered national and international awards, and I have published research on decentralized video streaming and sign language datasets. As an adjunct faculty member and mentor, I have guided students in programming, web development, and blockchain development.<br>
I am passionate about engaging in research and projects that enhance security and improve the quality of human life.`;
const researchAgenda = `My research interests center around Security and Privacy, with a specialized focus on Blockchain, Distributed Systems, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and Post-Quantum Cryptography. I aim to explore the intersection of these fields to develop innovative solutions that enhance the security and resilience of decentralized systems in the post-quantum era.<br>
It is undeniable that as technology advances, the need for security and privacy becomes paramount. As technology continues to evolve, securing our systems is increasingly important. This growing demand has sparked my interest in cryptography, with the aim of enhancing system security even in a post-quantum era. When considering security, protecting our finances is often a top priority. I believe that cryptocurrency will play a crucial role in establishing a secure financial system, which deepens my interest in its foundational technologies, including blockchain and distributed systems. Additionally, I am particularly fascinated by zero-knowledge proofs, as they offer an effective way to validate information without compromising privacy, and I am eager to explore this area further through research.`;
